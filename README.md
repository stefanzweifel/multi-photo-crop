# Multi Photo Crop

Detect and crop multiple photos from a single image. Perfect for digitalizing your old paper photo albums.

### Prerequisites

In order to use the script [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php) has to be installed on your system. (If you're on a Mac I suggest using Homebrew `brew install imagemagick`).

### Installing

The easiest way to install the the script is by using composer.

```shell
composer global require wnx/multi-photo-crop
```

If the installation was successful you should be able to execute the following command:

```shell
multi-photo-crop --version
```

If this didn't work, composer binary files are not automatically loaded in your shell.
You can also call the binary directly by using:

```
~/.composer/vendor/bin/multi-photo-crop --version
```

## Usage

After installing the package you can run the script like this:

```shell
multi-photo-crop run "/path/to/your/images/**/*.png" "~/Downloads/"
```

## Running the tests

There are some phpunit tests. You can run them with the following command.

```shell
phpunit
```
